An interface check for javascript.

## Concept

I just wanted to build an interface check for other people to use.


## Exposed methods

### interface

### data


## Thoughts

Later Options will have an option to just valdiate objects name positions and not recurse.

Functions we validate parameter count also.
Objects we recurse the validation.

Booleans we just validate their name location.
Strings we validate their name location.
Numbers we validate their name location.
Array we just validate their name locations.
